    <h3>What's the idea?</h3>
    <p>Build an inspiration library - packed full of books, articles, podcasts, films and much more to draw upon when looking to do something out of the ordinary.</p>
    
    <h3>Why is it so important?</h3>
    <p>They say there’s no such thing as a new idea. And they may well be right. When it comes to creating something completely different as part of your marketing strategy, often the seeds of the best ideas will be hidden in things that are already out there - and this could be from any place at any time.</p>
    <p>Curiosity remains one of the most important traits of creativity, so if you’re looking to do something really different that stands out from the crowd keep your eyes peeled and make sure you collect like a magpie.</p>

    <h3>How do you get started?</h3>
    <p>First up, make sure you have a place to keep all the great things you find. We think Slack is one of the best options for this, where you can set up a seperate ‘thread’ for different themes and use it to share inspiration with your team (and one central place to come back to when you’re thinking about the next big idea), but physical libraries and inspiration boards work just as well.</p>
    <p>Secondly, make sure you are signed up to some great weekly newsletters that will give you a range of the most interesting things out there. The likes of Web Curious, WIRED, Earnest Quarterly and Faris are a great place to start.</p>
    <p>Finally make sure to carve out time in your day to watch, read and listen to something a little different that you would never normally try - you never know which podcast or article might trigger you to come up with that one idea that changes the course of your marketing activity.</p>
