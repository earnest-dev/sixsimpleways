    <h3>What's the idea?</h3>
    <p>At concept stage, even before creating an MVP of your idea, test if your innovation has got legs by writing a press release, writing the FAQs and then (if it’s a new product or service) write the user manual.</p>
    
    <h3>Why is it so important?</h3>
    <p>When it comes to innovation there is a big difference between a great idea and a great execution. Far too often businesses will come up with new ideas that don’t fly in the real world - a lot of the time because they just sounded good in their head.</p>
    <p>Having the discipline to write a press release, FAQs and even a detailed manual for your idea, will do the job of bringing the idea to life and shining light on where the holes are, if they can be fixed and whether to press ahead with making it a reality.</p>
    <p>Most importantly, and despite learning from failures being a good thing, this can often flag issues before you have put time or money into creating something new and helps hedge your risk in new developments.</p>

    <h3>How do you get started?</h3>
    <p>Start with the press release. Write it as if you want it to get picked up by the biggest news source in your industry. Use the press release to really boil down the benefits of the thing you are creating and use made up customer quotes to show off what it might mean to your customers. This will test whether the idea really could exist in the real world, and why it is needed.</p>
    <p>Next up write the FAQs to start picking holes in your idea. What might people object to? Which parts are particularly hard to explain? As part of this process explain the idea to people in the business who have not heard about it and see which big questions they ask.</p>
    <p>Finally, the trickiest bit, write the user manual. This will force you to think about exactly how the idea works, the different components and how each of the features fit together to give you a clear view if this idea is going to sink or swim.</p>
