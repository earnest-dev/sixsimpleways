    <h2>Five. Stretch your creative muscles with made up briefs.</h2>

    <h3>What's the idea?</h3>
    <p>Run ideas sessions with made up briefs for brands you love (or are completely outside of your sector) and let your innovative, creative minds run wild - at Earnest we call these ‘Brief Encounters’.</p>
    
    <h3>Why is it so important?</h3>
    <p>Good ideas and inspiration for innovation often comes from strange places - and when trying to come up with ideas for your own business it’s easy to get stuck.</p>
    <p>Made up briefs enable you to get thinking outside of your normal world and outside of your comfort zone - which gets you thinking about tools, techniques and channels you might never had thought of before but could actually be applicable to your business.</p>

    <h3>How do you get started?</h3>
    <p>First, pick yourself a brand and make up a really interesting brief. There are three ways we would suggest doing this - either come up with a big problem to get your teeth stuck into (this could be a charity), a brief that relates to your company (i.e how would one of your competitors tackle a brief) or something that everyone in the room can relate to (for example in the past we looked at how Honest Burger could reposition itself a after night takeaway chain.)</p>
    <p>Like with the ideas sprints, make sure to get a group of the right people in a room and split up into groups to tackle the brief separately and come back to pitch the ideas to each other. Unlike a traditional ideas sprint, this should feel like fun and a more relaxed process so don’t be afraid to add your own twist to it.</p>
    <p>Finally make sure those ideas don’t go to waste - mock them up or create a prototype of the best ideas and have a think about how they potentially could be used in your own marketing programmes.</p>
