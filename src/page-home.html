    <h1>Six simple ways to start innovating your B2B marketing</h1>
    <p>When it comes to driving innovation within businesses, it should be the marketing department leading the charge, but it seems many are stuck behind the curve.</p>
    <p>And this might come as no surprise - the term ‘innovation’ is often shrouded in layers of jargon, confusion and a whole heap of BS from all angles.</p>
    <p>But we don’t think it should be this way; so we have put together this guide with six simple ways to ease marketers into innovation and make 2019 the year of doing something a little different.</p>

    <h3>Now is your time to get ahead</h3>
    <p>B2B Marketing departments who put time, effort and budget into innovating will be those who flourish in the future and any of these six steps should get you on the path to success.</p>
