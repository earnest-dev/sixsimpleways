    <h3>What's the idea?</h3>
    <p>Run a day‘s workshop (or an ideas sprint) to devise a series of marketing executions to test what works and what doesn’t for your marketing.</p>
    
    <h3>Why is it so important?</h3>
    <p>To start your journey into innovative new ways of marketing, it’s important to run new programmes to test and learn from the use of new channels or technologies.</p>
    <p>Running an ideas sprint is a chance to put yourself in a space to think differently about a specific brief (e.g. how do we get more visitors to our homepage) with the aim of devising ideas that are completely outside of the box.</p>
    <p>This is also a process in which no ideas are out of the window - so is the perfect chance to start stretching your creative muscles.</p>

    <h3>How do you get started?</h3>
    <p>The first step is to give yourself a good brief to work to - structured enough to develop creative solutions to, but also broad enough to allow you to devise a series of programmes different enough from each other to really test what works and what doesn’t.</p>
    <p>Secondly, make sure you have the right people in the room. Ten people with a mix of skills from across the company should give a good shape to the ideas sprint and ensure you come up with a variety of angles for tackling the brief has been set.</p>
    <p>Make sure to give yourself a whole day to dedicate to the process - spend the start of the day talking through the brief and exploring it (as well, obviously, as explaining where you hope to get to by the end). Spend the next part in two teams coming up with ideas a plenty and get them all up on a board using Post-It notes. For the final part of the day, come back together to pitch the ideas to each other - it’ll soon become clear which ones are non-starters and which have something to them. For the ideas with potential try to get down to two or three ideas to run as experiments and get going.</p>
