    <h2>One: Carve out a budget for innovation.</h2>

    <h3>What's the idea?</h3>
    <p>Put aside 10% of your campaign budget to spend on something you've never tested before, your customers have never seen before and your competitors have never done before.</p>
    
    <h3>Why is it so important?</h3>
    <p>Far too few CMOs are giving themselves a budget to try something new, and that's perfectly understandable - marketing is under huge pressure to deliver the numbers, pressure to show progress and importantly pressure to 'not fail'. But the truth is, if you don't do something different, someone else will. Leaving you to fade into the background - so in fact not taking RISKS? poses the biggest risk of failure. Giving yourself a set budget in each campaign or budget cycle to experiment with new channels, technologies and positioning gives you a chance to stand out from the competition and find the next big thing that could rocket the fortunes of your organisation. How do you get started? The best way to think about the 10% innovation spend is to split your campaign budget into three sections.</p>
    <p>The first 70% should go toward business as usual tactics - the stuff you know works, the stuff that is guaranteed to pull leads (and the kind of things you know your competition will be doing) - we're talking websites, press ads, online ads etc. (PH is this true - these aren't guaranteed bankers)</p>
    <p>The next 20% should go towards doing something a little different from the competition - upping your game and starting to use tactics that stand out. This could be anything from experiential activity, to simply trying a new channel (instagram paid ads for example.)</p>
    <p>The final 10%, the budget set aside for innovation, should be where you really push the boundaries and do something you've never tried before, something that your audience will find completely unexpected. You should think of the 10% as your marketing investment fund; some things that you test might not work, but with others the upside could be huge.</p>
