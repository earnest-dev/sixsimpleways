    <h2>Four. Look for ideas outside of the marketing team.</h2>

    <h3>What's the idea?</h3>
    <p>Run an ideas amnesty within your business - inviting people outside the marketing department to share innovative ideas for the company.</p>
    
    <h3>Why is it so important?</h3>
    <p>Despite often thinking they are the most creative people in the room, new ideas that can help grow and make businesses famous don’t have to come from inside the marketing department.</p>
    <p>Idea amnesties enable people who aren’t part of the traditional idea generations teams to share innovative solutions to things they have either seen in the business or for clients - these could unlock huge changes that might otherwise have been missed.</p>

    <h3>How do you get started?</h3>
    <p>First you need a good dose of internal communications to get things started. Promote this properly to the whole business through whichever channels are available to you (from slack to kitchen posters) - clearly explaining what you are doing and why you are doing it.</p>
    <p>Once everyone is on board, you need to make it as easy as possible for people to get their ideas down on paper. Remember that while Gary in finance might have some good thoughts, he might not be used to articulating them into a brief like the marketing department - so give really clear guidelines and ask the right questions.</p>
    <p>When the responses comes back you need to filter - set a criteria for how feasible an idea is e.g can it realistically be done within budget, does it help achieve a marketing goal, is it even possible in 2019!? (you’re bound to get a few ‘we need a better kettle in the kitchen’ responses) and whittle the thoughts down to five of the best which can then be developed further with your relevant partners and turned into actionable innovations.</p>
    <p>Finally, make sure to communicate back to the business about the whole process and which ideas are being taken forward (and of course to the individuals who took part whether you are using their ideas or not).</p>
